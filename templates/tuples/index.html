<h1>Tuples</h1>

<p>The 'tuple' is a Python type which is like a small list. Tuples are like a list but written within parenthesis, here is a tuple of three strings: <code>('a', 'b', 'c')</code>

<p>Accessing a tuple works like a list -- len, [ ], in, slices, loops -- but the big difference is that a tuple is immutable. It is built once and then never changes. There is no append() function.

<pre>
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c')
>>> len(t)
3
>>> t[0]
'a'
>>> 'c' in t
True
>>> t[0:2]
('a', 'b')
>>> t[0:2]
('a', 'b')
>>> t[0] = 'hi'   # no changing it!
Error:'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</pre>

<p>Tuples are useful where you have a fixed number of things to keep as a group -- e.g. an x,y coordinate pair stored in a len-2 tuple like (4, 10) keeps the x,y together as a unit. In contrast, a list is useful when you have an unlimited number of items you want to store together, such as the typical pattern of reading out of a file and using lst.append() to put all the items together in one list.

<p>Recall that dict-keys should be immutable. Therefore if you have some composite data that you want to use as a dict key, e.g. a string and an int, form them into a tuple ('meh', 16) and then use that as the key.


<h2>Tuples and Assignment</h2>

<p>One quirky but important use of tuples is assignment multiple variable at once, like this:

<pre>
>>> (x, y) = (12, 4)
>>> x
12
>>> y
4
</pre>

<p>The length of the left-hand-side and right-hand-side must be the same (CS terminology protip "lhs" and "rhs".)

<h2>Tuples and Multiple Value Return</h2>

<p>Communicating <b>in</b> to a function is a rich area: you can have any number of parameters, they each get a name. How do you communicate <b>out</b> of a function .. return 1 value. Returning 1 value covers 90% of the cases. But sometimes it really makes sense to return 2 or more values. The Pythonic way to do this is to return a tuple packing together the values. Like this

<pre>
def min2(a, b):
    """
    Given 2 ints, returns (True, min_val) if at least
    one is negative and min_val is the minimum value.
    Otherwise returns (False, None)
    """
    if a<0 or b<0:
        return (True, min(a, b))
    return (False, None)
</pre>

<p>There are 2 requirements:

<p>1. The function doc string must state the size and content-types of the returned tuple. There's no way the caller code can be written correctly without
this information.

<p>2. All paths should return a tuple of that same length, even if it is
(None, None), so that standard looking calling code of the form (x, y) = fn(..) works
without crashing should it hit the None case.


<p>Calling min2 looks like this, catching the len-2 tuple result into 2 variables.
<pre>
    (negative, min_val) = min2(a, b)
    if negative:
       ...
</pre>


<h2>Tuples and Dicts</h2>

<p>One handy use of tuples is the dict.items() function, which returns the entire contents of the dict as an list of len-2 (key, value) tuples.

<pre>
>>> d = {'a':1, 'd':4, 'c':2, 'b':3}
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'c': 2, 'b': 3}
>>> d.items()
dict_items([('a', 1), ('d', 4), ('c', 2), ('b', 3)])  # (key, value) tuples
>>> sorted(d.items())   # same tuples, sorted by key
[('a', 1), ('b', 3), ('c', 2), ('d', 4)]
</pre>

<p>Sorting of tuples goes left-to-right within each tuple - first sorting by all the [0] values across the tuples, then by [1], and so on.

<p>Once all the data has been loaded into a dict, it's natural to have a process-all-the-data phase. This can be written as a loop over the above d.items() list. The loop syntax below takes one tuple off the list for each iteration, setting the two variable, key and value each time:

<pre>
# Example: for loop setting key/value for each iteration
for key,value in d.items():
    # use key and value in here
</pre>

<p>This is a special version of the for loop, where there are multiple variables, and the number of variables matches the size of a tuples coming off the list. The above example, looping key,value over dict.items() is probably the most common use of this multiple-variable variant of the for loop.
